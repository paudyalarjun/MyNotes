Learning Asp Net Core
Hello, how are you all?

It's boring. Been trying to make this form since few days now and I am still facing some massive errors.

Oh, let's talk about the project.
This is the first ever project I ever created on Asp.Net Core.

The Register and login feature does not work currently. Register Works but for some reason I can't login. And I already gave up fixing it.

There are Notes, Students, Products, Department, Lecture and Teacher Options. They are all CRUDs. You can create new profile, view, edit and delete profile of each of those options there.

And then there is TeacherDepartment. I mapped id from Teacher and Department to create it. I used stored procedure to complete that.
Same applies for StudentLecture. I used Student and Lecture models to create this.


And then there is KycForm. It is probably the bigger one I tried to make, but it is still full of a lot of errors. There's photo upload option, which works correctly btw.
There's state and Districts dropdowns, provided by State and District models. Also, there's checkbox which I can use to fill up the temporary address fields using permanent address fields data.
Jquery is used to make those features, but I have no idea how those jquery code works, some of them I copied it, some of them, my seniors wrote it themselves, I just said umm umm, while they wrote it.

That is all for now.
